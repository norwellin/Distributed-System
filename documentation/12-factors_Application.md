   **Explanation:**
   One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.

   Treat backing services as attached resources.

   Strictly separate build and run stages.

7. **Processes**  
   Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.

8. **Port binding**  
   Export services via port binding.

9. **Concurrency**  
   Scale out via the process model.
