# 12-Factor App

1. **Codebase**  
   ðŸŒŸ**Explanation:**
   One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys.
   
   :rocket:**What We Did:**
   We created Docker images for both the front end and back end, so they can be deployed anywhere.


2. **Dependencies**
   ðŸŒŸ**Explanation:**
   Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.

   
   :rocket:**What We Did:**
   All the dependencies are put int the package.json

3. **Config**  
   ðŸŒŸ**Explanation:**
   Store config in the environment.

   :rocket:**What We Did:**
   We store our config in the .env file at the root directory of the shopping-app-frontend.

4. **Backing services** 
   ðŸŒŸ**Explanation:** 
   Treat backing services as attached resources.

   
   :rocket:**What We Did:**
   We implemented the API call separately in #apiServer.js, and since it currently relies on the axios library, it will be easier to modify in the future.

7. **Build, release, run**  
   Strictly separate build and run stages.

8. **Processes**  
   Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.

9. **Port binding**  
   Export services via port binding.

10. **Concurrency**  
   Scale out via the process model.

11. **Disposability**  
   Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.

12. **Dev/prod parity**  
    Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.

13. **Logs**  
    Treat logs as event streams.

14. **Admin processes**  
    Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.
